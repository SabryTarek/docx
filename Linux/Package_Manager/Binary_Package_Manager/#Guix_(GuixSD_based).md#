Guix downloaded pre-built binaries;or, if you explicitly chose to not use pre-built binaries, then probably Guix is still building software (see Substitutes, for more info).
each operation is in fact a transaction that creates a new generation.

profiles: a way to group package installations together
all users on the same system are free to use as many profiles as they want


guix package -m <>

That is nice, because then you can just edit that file to change your package set. Also, you can backup that file, copy it to another computer, or put it under version control
