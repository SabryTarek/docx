Learning vi is a Unix rite of passage, since it is universally available on Unix-like systems. On most Linux distributions, an enhanced version of the traditional vi editor called vim is used.



The true giant in the world of text editors is Emacs by Richard Stallman. Emacs contains (or can be made to contain) every feature ever conceived for a text editor. It should be noted that vi and Emacs fans fight bitter religious wars over which is better.
