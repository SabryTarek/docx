high level overview on how video streaming works. The first video is focused on the basic terminology and lingo
- Resolusion: Dimentions of your Image (Height * Width)
    + Full HD (1080p) -> 1080*1920
    + Ultra HD (4K) -> 3840*2160
- Frame Rate
- Codec
- Container
- bitRate












frame rate is the number of images you see per one second of your video okay so most of the tv is in 24 frames per second so also known as fps some videos maybe on youtube mostly you will see recorded with 30 frames per second and nowadays you can see also 60 frames per second and greater okay all this means is that for one second of video you get displayed 24 images with size being your resolution okay so that's frame rate and this is how video is essentially done
