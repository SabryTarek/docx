 i need to translate assembly code to a c code can i do it with Compiler Explorer

Hi: no, I'm afraid not. It's pretty tricky to turn assembly back into a high level language. It's an area of active research still. Check out some reverse engineering tools like IDA Pro and others, but I'm not aware of any decent open source systems for doing this. Certainly Compiler Explorer can't do this, I'm afraid
