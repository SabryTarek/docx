OpenGL is a Graphic API -> simplest Graphic API
- Modern OpenGL -> more low-level, big diff between it and Legacy one is shaders
- Legacy OpenGL -> easist, high-level andgive low-control, like presets
Graphic APIs:
    * cross-platform
        - OpenGL
        - Vulkun
    * native
        - DirectX
            - Direct3D
        - Metal -> mac
        - 

    material-system
    - Graphics Engine
    - Game Engine
    - Render Engine
