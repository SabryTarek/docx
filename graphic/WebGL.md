=======
- [Mesa](https://www.mesa3d.org/) is an open-source implementation of the OpenGL specification.
- a system for rendering interactive 3D graphics.
- Technically, OpenGL is just a specification, implemented by your graphics driver.
- There's no such thing like an OpenGL SDK library.
- There's just libGL.so which comes with your driver.
- To use it, you need bindings for your programming language of choice.
- If that is C, the "bindings" consist of just the header files.
- However you'll probably also want to use OpenGL extensions, which is easy using GLEW.
- OpenGL is defined and released by the OpenGL Architecture Review Board (ARB).

- OpenGL Software and hardware independent (Cross-platform)


* Graphics Card Architecture
    + Graphics Card = GPU
        - VRAM (VideoRAM) -> inside VRAM
        - GPU

- Microsoft Direct X
    - consist of collection of APIs
    - Direct #d is the equivant of OpenGL
    - Direct X 12 reeased at same time with Vulkan many differance than version 11
    - no Direct X SDK
    - embedd in windows from version 11
- OpenGL 4.5 -2014 then-> Vulkan (AMD) vk.<function_name>
- HLSL
- GLSL


 "Modern OpenGL" approach which is version 3.0
