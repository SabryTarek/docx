- Thick of it like TilwindCSS for Javascript
- much lighter library than Vue or React (has small footprint)
- syntax entirely borrowed from Vue (to quote the author)
- have no Virtual DOM
- add some polyfills for IE11.
- it's not meant to replace a view or react but serve as an alternative when you need JavaScript to do something minor 
+ Installation
    + NPM
    + CDN

it's very similar to vue
so you have a bunch of attributes that you just set in your HTML and you have state using this data attribute you can set your stay in here and then the scope of this state is within this element and all of its children and then you have events similar to view and you can toggle the state on them or even make methods if you want so yeah 
I think it's best use case is for minor UI stuff had like toggling the visibility of components

all you want to do is toggle the visibility of some components components like a drop-down menu a hamburger menu or tabs
