recursion is like one of those nested Russian dolls you open the egg and you find another egg you open that egg and you find another egg you open that egg and you find a base case

functional programming as a style has you passing data directly between functions rather than accumulating state within variables you can usually write really complex math operations all on one line with functional programming


Ocaml known for:
pattern matching and type inference instead of having an object and accessing his fields by asking nicely

generic type so you don't have to rewrite list out of pens for every custom type you come up with also you can easily make custom types
